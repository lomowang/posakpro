            Posak Jodian, an Amis who lives in Taipei. Posak is the given name
            and Jodian is the father’s name. Posak has a background in
            ethnolinguistics and Communication studies. She mainly uses video as
            a method and her own ethnic identity as a starting point, to observe
            the traditional field formulation of tribes and the urban life of
            the aborigines who left their hometown through long-term field
            research. Meanwhile, she participates in the scenes of various mass
            movements, and the various actions of young people in between the
            gaps of cities. Trying to use the ethnic and cultural actions as a
            fulcrum to open the boundaries between identity and recognition.
