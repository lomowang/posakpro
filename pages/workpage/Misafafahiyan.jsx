            <strong>Misafafahiyan</strong> Metamorphosis focuses on Hao Hao, a
            70-years-old Amis trans performer living in Fata’an, an Amis tribe
            of Taiwan’s indigenous peoples. The work includes a 16-minutes video
            and three photo printing puzzles. In the popular style of karaoke
            backing tracks, the music and sounds of Hao Hao’s daily life are
            interwoven through directing, dialogue, dress up, and self-mockery.
            The themes of the songs in the video range from depicting familial
            love, emotions upon returning to hometown, and the portrayal of
            nightlife. Hao Hao, attempting to bring the moving and labor
            experiences of Taiwan’s indigenous people and the displaced urban
            indigenous people’s bodies hidden in the last century into the
            contemporary art field through visual development. This creates an
            increasingly complex “historical image" of indigenous peoples,
            portraying a survival technique of “self-assembly" and a
            counter-attack path of gender differentiation.
